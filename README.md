## 3. Gameplay

### a. Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Scenario Presentation**: Players start with a scenario at the round table where different urban planning challenges are presented.
2. **Invite Representatives**: Players use buttons to invite representatives from Climate, Finance, and Society sectors to join the discussion.
3. **Engage in Discussion**: Each representative arrives and presents their perspective and proposals on the urban planning scenario.
4. **Decision Making**: Players must make decisions based on the input from the representatives, balancing the trade-offs between different proposals.
5. **Manage Complexity**: As more representatives join, the player must handle the increasing complexity and manage time effectively to keep the discussions productive.
6. **Resolution**: When the game becomes too chaotic, Haris, the consultant, intervenes to help resolve conflicts and guide the player towards an optimal solution.

### b. Mechanics
- **Time Management**: Players must respond to representatives within a set time limit to maintain engagement and progress.
- **Decision Making**: Choose between different urban planning proposals, each with its own set of trade-offs and consequences.
- **Stress Simulation**: The game increases in complexity and pressure over time to simulate the real-world stress of urban planning decision-making.

### c. Controls
- **Mouse Click or Touchscreen Tap**: Select representatives and interact with the user interface elements.

### d. Formal Objectives
- **Integration**: Successfully integrate various proposals into a cohesive and sustainable city plan.
- **Balance**: Balance the needs and interests of different stakeholders to achieve optimal outcomes for the city.
- **Satisfaction**: Ensure high satisfaction levels among all representatives by addressing their concerns and incorporating their proposals effectively.

- **Audio Cues**: Use sound alerts to signal new messages, the arrival of representatives, and important events during the discussions.

### f. Failure States
- **Missed Engagement**: Failure to invite and engage representatives in time leads to the discussion falling apart and the scenario failing.
